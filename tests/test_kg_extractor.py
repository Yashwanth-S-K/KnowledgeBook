"""M1 — Two-stage KG extraction tests.

Stage A (macro): one LLM call producing course overview + 5-9 macro topics.
Stage B (micro): per-chunk concept extraction with topics passed in,
each concept attached to a `parent_topic` (referencing topic concept_id).

All tests offline. The router is a hand-rolled stub that records calls
and returns canned structured-JSON responses, mirroring the discipline
used in tests/test_router_intent.py and tests/test_agents.py.
