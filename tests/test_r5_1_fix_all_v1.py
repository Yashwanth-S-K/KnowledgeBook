"""R5-1 fix-all v1 regression tests.

After the initial R5-1 land (commit `22c8d24`), a 4-route review-swarm
surfaced 6 MEDIUM + 6 LOW items. fix-all v1 lands all 12; these tests
pin each fix so a future refactor breaks loudly rather than silently
reverting.

  F1   multi-root layout radius — roots at 0.5*R, descendants +1 depth
  F2   Stage B re-flattened (no per-file serialisation)
  F3   `_chapter_slug` with sha1[:8] so similar filenames don't collide
  F4   Stage A prompt re-worded for per-chapter (3-5 topics)
  F5   `_overlay_user_edits` rewrites legacy `root_{course}` references
  F6   `_kg_to_mindmap` legacy fallback exposes `rootIds: [chosen]`
  F7   Stage A incremental progress emit (not just 0/100)
  F8   `_chunk_bucket_key` agrees on bucketing + lookup; "(unknown)" path
  F9   Orphan leaf drops edge rather than misattribute to roots[0]
  F10  Stage A exception log uses `getattr(exc, "code", type.__name__)`
  F11  `_sanitize_filename_for_prompt` strips backticks/quotes/braces
  F12  Legend reads `prepared.rootIds.length` (not just visNodes filter)

All tests offline.
