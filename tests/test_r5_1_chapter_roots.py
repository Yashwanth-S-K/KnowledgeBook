"""R5-1 — Knowledge Graph chapter roots.

User direction (2026-05-11): each uploaded source_file becomes its own KG
root (concept_type="root", depth=0) so "chapter" is the unit of the mental
model, not the whole course. These tests pin:

1. Per-file Stage A: extractor runs Stage A once per source_file with
   only that file's chunks visible in the prompt. Two files = two LLM
   calls. The course-wide overview is gone.
2. Multi-root edge wiring: each chapter's topics part-of-edge to that
   chapter's root; orphan leaves attach to their own file's root, not
   a foreign chapter's.
3. Merger preserves per-chapter same-named topics: two chapters with a
   topic named "Backpropagation" persist as two distinct topic nodes,
   each part-of its own root.
4. Stage A partial failure: if one file's Stage A errors but others
   succeed, the failed file still gets a chapter root (with empty
   overview); all its leaves attach as orphans.
5. `_kg_to_mindmap` exposes `rootIds: list[str]` listing every chapter
   root (stable-ordered), with the first one mirrored as `id`/`label`/
   `children` for back-compat.
6. Server-side delete_node refuses ANY concept_type=="root" — invariant
   F13 holds for all chapter roots, not just the first.

All tests offline. The router is the same hand-rolled stub used in
test_kg_extractor.py.
