"""Pin the pptx ↔ pdf dedup pass in `collect_files`.

User scenario (R5-2 fix-all v4 #1): student drags `lecture1.pptx` AND
`lecture1.pdf` (the exported handout) into the upload dialog. Pre-fix,
both files chunked → sources panel showed two rows for the same lecture
and FAISS double-counted the slide content. The dedup pass now drops
the pdf in favor of the semantically-richer pptx.
