"""QA prompt supplementation policy (2026-05-16).

Before this change, `qa_system` rule 1 said "Answer based ONLY on the
provided reference documents" and rule 6 said "If documents don't cover
the question, say so honestly". This produced "材料中没有直接介绍 X"
refusals for questions where the documents touched adjacent concepts
(e.g. "最大熵" matched n-gram / 古德-图灵 / 朴素贝叶斯 chunks via
graphrag but no chunk defined 最大熵).

New policy: instead of refusing, split the reply in two — cite whatever
fragments the documents DO have, then add a "补充背景" section that
supplements with general knowledge (without citations). The model
should only refuse outright when documents have ZERO mention AND
general knowledge is unhelpful.

This file pins the policy by checking the prompt text + low_confidence
addendum. Behavioral verification (does the LLM actually two-part
answer?) needs manual curl testing since we don't want LLM calls in
unit tests.
