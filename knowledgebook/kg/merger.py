    F1 (review-swarm): the dedup key distinguishes root / topic / leaf by
    `concept_type` so a Stage A topic "Optimization" and a Stage B leaf
    "Optimization" don't collapse into one record (their concept_ids
    differ, so structural part-of edges referencing the discarded id were
    silently dropped by `KnowledgeGraph.add_relations`).

    R5-1: for `root` and `topic` types the dedup key also includes the
    `concept_id` (which encodes the chapter slug — see
    `kg/extractor.py:extract_from_chunks`). Two chapters with a same-named
    macro topic ("Backpropagation" in both Lecture 3 and Lecture 7) now
    persist as distinct nodes, each part-of its own chapter root, instead
    of merging into a single floating topic. Leaves continue to dedup by
    `(type, name)` because a leaf-level concept like "Gradient descent"
    referenced from two chapters IS the same concept (the merger pools
    their source_chunks so the student can jump to either citation).
