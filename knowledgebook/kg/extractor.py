"""LLM-based concept and relation extraction from text chunks.

R5-1 (2026-05-11): chapter roots. The course no longer has a single
`course_overview` root — each uploaded source file becomes its own root
(`concept_type="root"`, depth=0) so the student's mental model "one
chapter = one root" matches the visual graph. Stage A runs per file
(bounded by an `asyncio.Semaphore(3)` so a 20-file upload doesn't
fan out 20 simultaneous LLM calls); Stage B's chunk-level extraction
uses that file's topics as the parent_topic vocabulary.

  Stage A — `extract_course_overview_and_topics`
    One LLM call sees a single file's chunk heads and returns 3-5 macro
    topics + a one-line chapter overview. Topics become depth=1 Concept
    nodes (concept_type="topic"); topic_id encodes both the course slug
    and the file slug so two chapters with a same-named topic don't
    collide in the merger.

  Stage B — `extract_concepts_from_chunk`
    Per-chunk LLM call, fed the chunk's chapter topics. Each extracted
    concept declares which topic it belongs to via `parent_topic` (the
    topic's concept_id, resolved client-side from a per-file name map).
    Concepts that don't fit any topic get parent_topic=None and are
    later mounted under that file's chapter root.

  Orchestration — `extract_from_chunks`
    Group chunks by source_file → per-file Stage A (parallel, capped) →
    per-file Stage B (parallel batches) → synthesize one root per file
    with part-of edges leaf→topic→chapter_root. If a file's Stage A
    fails its chapter root still gets created with an empty overview;
    its leaves attach as orphans. If every file's Stage A fails the
    function falls back to legacy single-stage extraction (no roots,
    no topics) so the user still gets *something*.

    2026-05-13 cross-lingual fix: pre-fix the text was just `name。definition`,

    English slide deck ends up with concept names like "Self-Attention" and

    Chinese-named concepts from sibling chapters higher than the actual
    English match, so GraphRAG silently routes to the wrong file.

    The fix: when chunk text lookup is available (provided by extractor +
    graph_search lazy-recompute), append up to ~300 chars of the FIRST
    source chunk's text. This grounds the concept embedding in the real
    domain vocabulary that appears in the source — "Self-Attention" gets
    the surrounding "Transformer Positional Encoding Multi-Head Q K V
    softmax attention weights..." context, which materially raises the
    cosine for any query touching the same vocab, regardless of language.

    If every file's Stage A fails or yields no topics, falls back to
    legacy single-stage extraction (no roots, no topics, just per-chunk
    concepts) so we don't regress on a fully-degraded LLM. A partial
    failure (some files succeed, some fail) still produces chapter
    roots for the successful files; the failed files get a root with
    empty overview and all their leaves attach as orphans.

    ``progress_callback(stage, percent)`` where ``stage`` is one of
    ``"kg_stage_a"``/``"kg_stage_b"`` and ``percent`` is 0–100. Server-side
    upload streaming uses this to drive a live progress bar; existing
    callers that omit it are unaffected.
