# Cap text returned per call to bound prompt growth in long agent loops.
# 8KB is enough for a normal slide / paragraph; rare oversized chunks get
# truncated with an explicit "(truncated, N more)" tail so the model knows.

DESCRIPTION = """Read the full text of a single chunk by its chunk_id.

Usage:
- Use this to expand context when the truncated text in a `search_kb` result isn't enough to answer.
- chunk_id values are stable across the session — copy them verbatim from a previous search result.
- Returns {chunk_id, course_id, source_file, location, text}. The text field is the chunk's full body (not truncated).
- If the chunk is not found, returns {error: "not_found", chunk_id}. Don't retry — the id is wrong or the index has been rebuilt.
- Cheap; safe to call several times in parallel (the loop batches read-only tools).
