r"""Full-course note generation: per-file parallel LLM calls → programmatic
concat → single LLM review/polish pass.

Replaces the single-shot path (note_generator) for the "Generate full-course
notes" entry point. The single-shot skill remains the implementation for
topic-scoped notes (when `topic` is provided).

Design contract (agreed with user, 2026-05-11):
  - 1 LLM call per source_file (parallelism capped via asyncio.Semaphore=4)
  - Per-file outputs sanitized via latex_sanitizer.check() — failures
    surface as file_error events, do not abort the batch.
  - Programmatic merge: \section{<file>} wrap, idx-ordered, no LLM cost.
  - Single LLM review pass over the merged draft for terminology
    consistency + cross-references + duplicate-definition collapse.
  - Final body sanitized via check_unbounded() (forbidden-command scan
    without the 80KB cap — a 20-file course legitimately exceeds it).

The endpoint side (api/server.py) consumes these helpers and emits NDJSON
events progressively, so the first finished file shows in the UI while
the others are still running.

# Cache hardening v1 (2026-05-11):

#     which without a lock loses the other writer's entry under concurrent
#     fan-out. We keep one asyncio.Lock per course_id, lazy-initialised in
#     _get_course_cache_lock. Different courses don't contend.
#
# (b) Prompt version hash. If the team edits NOTE_FORMAT_LATEX /
#     NOTE_GENERATION_PROMPT / NOTE_MERGE_REVIEW_PROMPT, every cached
#     entry was produced by an outdated prompt and MUST regenerate.
#     _NOTE_PROMPT_VERSION is a stable sha1[:8] hash over the concatenation
#     of those three prompt strings, computed at import time. Each cache
#     entry now carries this field and plan_for_course treats a mismatch
#     as a miss.
#
# (c) Envelope schema. We wrap on-disk JSON in {"version", "entries",
#     "prompt_version"} so future shape changes can read-migrate. load_cache
#     accepts both v0 (bare-dict) legacy and v1 envelope. save_cache always

    body returns, which makes the UI freeze for the 5-30s a typical
    LLM call takes. The user perceives Notes generation as flickering
    between "stuck silence" (file phase) and "smooth streaming"
    (review phase). Streaming the file phase too smooths the experience.

    Sanitization happens once at the end on the accumulated content —
    the same ``check()`` gate the non-stream path uses. Caller is

    ``max_retries`` (default 1 = total 2 attempts) covers proxy-side
    mid-stream TCP resets that some providers issue when per-tenant SSE
    concurrency caps fire. The retry re-runs
