    """End-of-stream marker yielded by ``complete_stream`` when the upstream

    rather than completing naturally.

    Why a sentinel instead of an exception: a truncated stream still
    delivered useful partial content; callers should keep that content and
    surface a visible "⚠️ truncated" affordance, not abort. Tagging the
    end-of-stream with a typed sentinel lets the existing
    ``async for delta in router.complete_stream(...)`` shape keep working
    while letting opt-in callers `isinstance`-guard for it::

        truncated = False
        async for item in router.complete_stream(...):
            if isinstance(item, TruncationSignal):
                truncated = True
                continue
            partial += item

    ``reason`` carries the upstream-reported reason string verbatim
    ("length" for chat.completions, "max_output_tokens" for the codex
    responses API) so logs can attribute the truncation precisely.
    """
    reason: str = "length"


# Public yield type for `complete_stream`. Backends MAY yield a single
# trailing TruncationSignal; all other yielded items are content delta
# strings. Existing callers that only `+= delta` keep working because
# Python's string concat will raise TypeError on a sentinel instance —
# but the sentinel is only emitted at end-of-stream, AFTER the last
# delta, so a caller that breaks out of the loop on first non-str item
# (or simply guards `if isinstance(item, str)`) is safe.

class LLMBackend(ABC):
    """Base class for all LLM backends.

    ``name`` is the routing key — set to the class-family default
    ("openai" / "claude") at the class level, then overridden to the
    provider id ("openai-main", "claude-main", or a user-added id) by
    ``ModelRouter._build_backend`` at construction time so log lines
    and cross-review's "alternate" lookup track the provider id
    instead of the class family.

    ``kind`` is the providers-matrix shape ("openai_compat",
    "openai_compat_local", "anthropic"). Default is "" so any future
    code path that instantiates a backend without going through
    ``_build_backend`` (e.g. unit tests, direct construction in a CLI
    helper) doesn't ``AttributeError`` on ``getattr(b, "kind", "")``
    — but callers that need to filter by kind (``get_openai_compat``,
    the agent-stream endpoint) must still go through
    ``_build_backend`` so the value is populated correctly.
