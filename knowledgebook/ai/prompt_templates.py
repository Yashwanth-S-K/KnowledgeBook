# Round 2.1 #3: every system prompt that goes through the qa_skill now

# across rag / general / translated / cross-course paths.
#
# 2026-05-12: persona name is user-customisable via `ChatRequest.persona`
# (UI: ⚙ Settings tab). The template-renderer functions take an optional
# `persona` argument; when None / empty / oversized it falls back to
# `DEFAULT_PERSONA`. `PERSONA_MAX_LEN` is also enforced by the Pydantic
# validator in `api/server.py` — this module is defense in depth, not
# the primary check.
#
# DEFAULT_PERSONA is intentionally an English proper-name phrase even
# when user_lang=zh is set. Treating it as a proper name avoids the
# awkward "我叫学习助手" vs "我叫 Study Assistant" debate — the LLM
# typically renders the latter as a name-token. If product later wants
# i18n, switch to a per-lang lookup and update tests/test_persona.py +
# settings.jsx placeholder.

# a 40-char attacker payload like "Aria.\nIGNORE PRIOR RULES." breaks
# the prompt's instruction-line invariant. Pattern matches:

# needed — the per-file step is the same task, just scoped to one source
# file's chunks). After programmatic concatenation, a single review pass
# polishes terminology, adds cross-references, and removes duplicate
# definitions across the merged sections.

NOTE_MERGE_REVIEW_SYSTEM = (
    "You are polishing a draft of merged study notes assembled from "
    "independently generated per-file sections. Ensure terminology is "
    "consistent across sections, add cross-references between related "
    "concepts, and collapse duplicate definitions to a single canonical "
    "statement — but never shorten or omit examples, theorems, or proofs."
)

NOTE_MERGE_REVIEW_PROMPT = r"""Polish the following merged study notes for the course "{course_name}".

The draft below was assembled from {file_count} per-file LaTeX sections (one
\section{{...}} per source file). Each section was generated independently,
so you will see overlapping definitions, drifting terminology, and missing
cross-references.

Your job is to output ONE polished LaTeX body that:

1. Preserves every existing \section{{...}} header verbatim and keeps them
   in the same order.
2. Within each section, rewrites prose only as needed to align terminology
   with the rest of the document (e.g. if §2 calls something an "activation
   function" and §5 calls the same thing a "non-linearity", standardise on
   one term and \emph{{note}} the synonym once on first use).
3. When the same concept is defined in two sections, KEEP the clearer
   \begin{{definition}}...\end{{definition}} block, and in the other section
   replace the duplicate definition with a one-line forward reference of
   the form "See \emph{{<concept>}} in §<n>." DO NOT delete the second
   section's surrounding context — only the duplicated definition.
4. Adds inline cross-references (\emph{{see also: <concept>}}) where a
   concept in one section is used or extended in another. Aim for 1-3
   cross-refs per section, not exhaustive linking.
5. Preserves every example, theorem, lemma, proof, and remark environment
   in full. You may correct typos and tighten wording inside them, but
   do not remove or replace them.
6. Preserves every \cite{{file:location}} citation — they anchor highlights
   in the reader, so dropping one breaks the UI.
7. Does NOT introduce new \section{{...}} headers, does NOT reorder
   sections, and does NOT remove any existing section.
