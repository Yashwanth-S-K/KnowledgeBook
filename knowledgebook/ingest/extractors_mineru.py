"""MinerU-backed PDF extractor.

Use this when you need high-quality formula + table + layout recovery
(e.g., HMM / DL slides where PyMuPDF reduces equations to single-character
columns). About 4x slower than PyMuPDF per page steady-state (~3-4s/page
on M4 CPU after model load), so it's an opt-in pipeline, not the default.

Two execution paths:

  1. **Persistent server (preferred)** — On first call we launch one
     `mineru-api` subprocess bound to 127.0.0.1, then route every PDF to
     it via HTTP `POST /file_parse`. The ~30-45s model load is paid once
     per parent process; subsequent uploads start at steady-state.
     `_get_or_start_mineru_server()` is the lazy singleton; an atexit
     hook sends SIGTERM at shutdown. The FastAPI `_warm_mineru_server`
     startup hook kicks the singleton at boot so the first upload
     doesn't pay the load on the request hot path.

  2. **Subprocess CLI fallback** — When the server fails to start or
     `MINERU_SERVER_DISABLED=1` is set, we fall back to the legacy
     `mineru -p <dir>` batch path: stage PDFs in a temp dir, run one
     subprocess (paying full cold start), parse content_list.json from
     each per-PDF output dir.

Both paths converge on `_blocks_to_pages(blocks)` and yield
`list[PageInfo]` with 1-based page numbers, equations as `$$...$$`,
tables as raw HTML, and images as escaped markdown image links.

Concurrency: on macOS, mineru-api hard-pins `max_concurrent_requests=1`
(see `mineru.cli.fast_api:251` — `is_mac_environment()` branch), so
`asyncio.gather` over multiple PDFs serialises inside the server. On
Linux, operators raise it via `MINERU_API_MAX_CONCURRENT_REQUESTS`.

Device selection: `mineru_auto_device()` picks `cuda` when
`torch.cuda.is_available()`, otherwise `cpu`. **MPS is never
auto-selected** — under MPS the pipeline backend hangs at
`DocAnalysis init` with 0% CPU, so Apple Silicon stays on CPU.
Operators can force any device (including `mps` if they want to
experiment) via `MINERU_DEVICE_MODE` in the env.
