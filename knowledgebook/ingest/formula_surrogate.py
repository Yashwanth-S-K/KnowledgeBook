"""LaTeX → natural-language surrogate text for formula-bearing chunks.

The MinerU extractor recovers equations as LaTeX (`$$\\sum_t \\alpha_t(i)\\beta_t(i)$$`),
which is great for the answer LLM but terrible for retrieval:

  - BM25's character-bigram tokenizer slices `\\sum` into `\\s/su/um/m_` — garbage.
  - MiniLM L6 embeddings rarely saw LaTeX in training, so `\\frac{1}{N}` lands
    in a random region of the embedding space far from the Chinese question
    "前向概率怎么算".

The fix: for every chunk where `has_formula=True`, ask an LLM to rewrite the
text so each `$$...$$` (and `$...$`) is replaced with a natural-language
description in the same language as the surrounding prose. Store this on
the chunk as `embed_text`. Retrieval (FAISS vector + BM25) uses
`embed_text or text`; the answer LLM still gets the original `text` with
full LaTeX intact.

Cost shape:
  - One small LLM call per formula-bearing chunk (~500 input + ~300 output tok)
  - Concurrency cap so a 100-chunk course doesn't fan out 100 simultaneous
    requests
  - Per-chunk timeout — on failure we leave `embed_text=None` so the index
    falls back to the raw text. Net effect: surrogate is purely additive,
    never worse than the no-surrogate baseline.

Rules:
1. Replace $$...$$ blocks with "Formula: <natural language description>", embedded in original position.
2. Replace inline $...$ with "<natural language description>".
3. Use clear mathematical terms: alpha -> alpha or forward variable, beta -> beta or backward variable, sum -> summation, int -> integral, prod -> product, partial -> partial derivative, delta -> Viterbi variable.
4. Keep state variables like q_t / s_j in easily searchable form.
5. Preserve all non-formula text completely.
6. Match output language with the input text.

Example:
Input: Viterbi variable δ_t(i) satisfies recursion $$\\delta_t(j) = \\max_i [\\delta_{t-1}(i) \\cdot a_{ij}] \\cdot b_j(o_t)$$
Output: Viterbi variable δ_t(i) satisfies recursion Formula: at time t state j Viterbi variable equals maximum over state i at time t-1 of Viterbi variable times state transition probability a_ij from i to j times emission probability b_j(o_t) of observation o_t at state j at time t

Output ONLY the rewritten text, without any markdown formatting, explanations, or prefixes/suffixes.

Input:
{text}

Output:"""
