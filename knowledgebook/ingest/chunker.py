# ── Formula block atomicity (R5/MinerU step ②) ─────────────────────
# The token-based splitter has no concept of "$$...$$ is a unit". For
# any page where a `$$...$$` block straddles `chunk_size`, the splitter
# happily cuts the block in half — chunk N ends with "\\boldsymbol" and
# chunk N+1 starts with "_ { t } } = ..." (real evidence from
# HMMViterbiDemo). Neither half is searchable, neither half is parseable
# to the answer LLM, and BM25/embedding tokenisers compound the damage.
#
# Strategy: before token-splitting, replace every `$$...$$` (DOTALL,
# non-greedy) with a short placeholder `NN` — two Unicode
# Private Use Area characters that tiktoken encodes as a single byte-
# fallback token each, plus a 1-3 char index. Token total ~5-7,
# essentially never straddles a typical chunk boundary. After split +
# decode, swap placeholders back to original LaTeX. If a half placeholder
# does survive at a chunk edge (unmatched `` without ``),
# strip the dangling marker — better than emitting `<<F0...` garbage to
# the user.
#
# Choice of  / : BMP private-use chars, can't collide with
# real LaTeX content; encoded by cl100k_base as <byte-fallback> tokens
# so the placeholder is opaque to the splitter — it can't be
# accidentally "decoded back" mid-split.
